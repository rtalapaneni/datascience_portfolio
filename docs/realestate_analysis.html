      <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The Real Estate Analysis project explores property market data to
          uncover trends, identify key market drivers, and provide insights for
          investors and stakeholders. The analysis focuses on understanding the
          factors that influence property values and market dynamics.

      <!-- Data Description -->
      <section id="data-description">
        <h2>Data Description</h2>
        <p>
          The dataset includes a variety of property attributes such as
          location, property type, size, number of bedrooms, year built, and
          pricing information. Additional economic and demographic variables
          have also been incorporated to provide a comprehensive view of the
          real estate market.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Data Preprocessing -->
      <section id="data-preprocessing">
        <h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>
        <p>
          Data cleaning and preprocessing were essential steps before analysis.
          Key preprocessing tasks included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Handling missing or inconsistent data entries</li>
          <li>
            Normalizing numerical features and scaling variables where necessary
          </li>
          <li>Encoding categorical variables for analysis</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These steps ensured the dataset was reliable and ready for subsequent
          analysis and modeling.

      <!-- Exploratory Data Analysis -->
      <section id="exploratory-data-analysis">
        <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>
        <p>
          Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted to identify patterns and
          trends in the real estate market. Analysis included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Examining the distribution of property prices and sizes</li>
          <li>
            Investigating the relationship between property attributes and
            market value
          </li>
          <li>
            Identifying geographical trends and the impact of location on
            pricing
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Modeling / Predictive Analysis -->
      <section id="modeling">
        <h2>Predictive Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          To better understand the factors influencing property prices, various
          predictive models were applied, including linear regression and
          decision tree-based methods. The models were evaluated using metrics
          such as RMSE and R-squared, with the goal of identifying the most
          significant predictors of property value.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Results -->
      <section id="results">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
          The analysis revealed that factors such as location, property size,
          and age of the property are critical determinants of market value. The
          predictive models achieved promising accuracy, indicating that these
          variables can be effectively used to forecast property prices and
          inform investment decisions.

      <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          In summary, the Real Estate Analysis project provides valuable
          insights into the dynamics of property markets. By leveraging
          data-driven approaches, the project identifies key factors that
          influence property values and supports strategic decision-making for
          investors and market analysts.
