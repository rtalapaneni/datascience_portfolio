      <!-- Introduction -->
      <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This project investigates customer churn in the telecommunications
          industry. The analysis focuses on understanding the key factors that
          influence a customerâ€™s decision to leave a service provider. The
          ultimate goal is to build predictive models that can identify
          customers at risk of churning.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Data Description -->
      <section id="data-description">
        <h2>Data Description</h2>
        <p>
          The dataset includes various customer-related attributes such as
          demographics, account details, and usage patterns. Important variables
          include customer tenure, contract type, payment methods, monthly
          charges, and other service-related features that provide insights into
          customer behavior.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Data Preprocessing -->
      <section id="data-preprocessing">
        <h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>
        <p>
          Prior to analysis, the data underwent extensive cleaning and
          preprocessing. Steps included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Handling missing values and outliers</li>
          <li>Encoding categorical variables for model compatibility</li>
          <li>Normalizing or scaling numerical features</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These steps were crucial in ensuring that the data was well-prepared
          for both exploratory analysis and the development of predictive
          models.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Exploratory Data Analysis -->
      <section id="exploratory-data-analysis">
        <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>
        <p>
          EDA was performed to understand the distribution of key variables and
          to identify trends that differentiate churned customers from those who
          remain. The analysis revealed:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Distinct patterns in tenure and monthly charges between churned and
            non-churned customers
          </li>
          <li>
            Correlations between certain service features and the likelihood of
            churn
          </li>
          <li>
            Insights into customer demographics that may contribute to churn
            behavior
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Predictive Modeling -->
      <section id="predictive-modeling">
        <h2>Predictive Modeling</h2>
        <p>
          Several machine learning models were explored to predict customer
          churn, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Logistic Regression</li>
          <li>Decision Trees</li>
          <li>Random Forests</li>
          <li>Ensemble Methods</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision,
          recall, and ROC-AUC to determine their effectiveness in predicting
          churn.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Results -->
      <section id="results">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
          The best-performing models demonstrated strong predictive capabilities
          with a ROC-AUC around 0.85. The analysis identified key drivers of
          churn, including customer tenure, contract type, and monthly charges.
          These insights can be leveraged to implement targeted retention
          strategies.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          The Telco Customer Churn analysis successfully highlighted the main
          factors influencing customer retention in the telecommunications
          industry. By understanding these factors, companies can proactively
          address the issues that lead to churn, potentially reducing customer
          turnover and enhancing overall business performance.
