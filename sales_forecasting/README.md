# Sales Forecasting

## Project Description
This project focuses on predicting future sales using historical sales data. Techniques like ARIMA and LSTM are used for time-series analysis and forecasting.

## Features
- Time-series analysis and decomposition
- Forecasting using ARIMA and LSTM
- Evaluation of model accuracy

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Statsmodels
- TensorFlow/Keras

## Dataset
[Store Sales Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/weekly-sales-transactions)

## Key Insights
- Seasonal patterns identified in sales data.
- LSTM performed better than ARIMA for long-term forecasts.

## Results
Forecasting accuracy: X%
