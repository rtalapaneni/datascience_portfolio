# Movie Recommendation System

## Project Description
This project demonstrates how to build a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques. The system uses the MovieLens dataset to recommend movies based on user preferences.

## Features
- Collaborative filtering-based recommendations
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis
- Model evaluation using metrics like RMSE

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Dataset
[MovieLens Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grouplens/movielens-20m-dataset)

## Key Insights
- User-based and item-based collaborative filtering compared
- Recommendations tailored for individual users

## Results
The model achieves a prediction accuracy of X (RMSE: Y).
